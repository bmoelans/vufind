; Set this to true in order to use a combined search handler drop-down as specified
; in the [CombinedHandlers] section below.
combinedHandlers = false

; Should we include AlphaBrowse options below the configured combined search options?
; (This setting is ignored unless combinedHandlers is set to true). See also the
; [AlphaBrowse] section of config.ini.
includeAlphaBrowse = false

; If includeAlphaBrowse is true, this label will be used to group the browse values
; together in the drop-down (see group[] setting below). Set to false for no label.

; If combinedHandlers is true, and a search option is selected which falls outside
; of the defined options in [CombinedHandlers] below, this group label will be
; applied to the option (see group[] setting below; set to false for no label).
defaultGroupLabel = false

; This section controls the "combined handlers" drop-down. It must contain groups
; of settings with the following keys:
;
; type[] = "VuFind" for an internal search module or "External" for an external URL
; target[] = Search class ID for "VuFind" type, URL for "External" type; by default,
;            the user's search terms will be appended to the end of the URL in
;            "External" mode. You may use a %%lookfor%% placeholder string in the
;            URL to force the query to be injected at a specific position.
; label[] = Label for this value (subject to translation)
; group[] = Option group label to wrap around the option(s) represented here; if
;           multiple External targets have the same group value, they will be
;           clustered together. Set to false for no grouping.
